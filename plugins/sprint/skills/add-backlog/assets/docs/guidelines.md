# Documentation Guidelines

Guidelines for documentation backlog items.

## Task Breakdown Considerations

### What makes a good docs Task?
- One documentation page
- One section of a guide
- One API reference group
- One tutorial or how-to
- One diagram or visual

### What's too big?
- "Write all documentation" → One page per Task
- "Document the entire API" → One endpoint group per Task
- "Create user guide" → One chapter/section per Task

## Quality Checklist

When adding docs tasks, consider:

- [ ] Who is the target audience?
- [ ] What's the appropriate depth/detail level?
- [ ] Are there existing docs to reference or update?
- [ ] Is the scope one coherent topic?

## Type-Specific Fields

For docs Features, consider adding:

```markdown
**Audience**: Developers | End Users | Admins
**Format**: Guide | Reference | Tutorial | FAQ
**Existing Docs**: [links to related docs]
```

## Writing Principles

1. **Know your audience** - Adjust language and depth accordingly
2. **One concept per section** - Don't overload
3. **Examples over explanations** - Show, don't just tell
4. **Keep it current** - Outdated docs are worse than no docs
