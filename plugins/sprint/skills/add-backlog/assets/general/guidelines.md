# General Guidelines

Guidelines for general-purpose backlog items.

## Task Breakdown Considerations

### What makes a good general Task?
- One specific deliverable
- One clear outcome
- One focused activity
- Completable in a single session

### What's too big?
- Vague goals without clear deliverables
- Multiple unrelated activities bundled together
- Open-ended work without completion criteria

## Quality Checklist

When adding general tasks, consider:

- [ ] Is there a clear deliverable?
- [ ] Can we define "done"?
- [ ] Is the scope realistic for one session?
- [ ] Are dependencies clear?

## Type-Specific Fields

For general Features, consider adding:

```markdown
**Deliverable**: What will be produced?
**Done When**: How do we know it's complete?
**Dependencies**: What's needed to start?
```

## General Principles

1. **Be specific** - Vague tasks lead to vague results
2. **Define done** - Clear completion criteria
3. **One thing at a time** - Focus beats multitasking
4. **Document as you go** - Don't rely on memory
