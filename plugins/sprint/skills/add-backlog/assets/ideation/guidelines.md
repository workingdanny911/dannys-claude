# Ideation Guidelines

Guidelines for brainstorming and exploration backlog items.

## Task Breakdown Considerations

### What makes a good ideation Task?
- Explore one specific question or hypothesis
- Research one topic area
- Compare 2-3 alternatives for one decision
- Prototype one concept
- Validate one assumption

### What's too big?
- "Figure out the architecture" → Break into specific decisions
- "Research all options" → One comparison per Task
- "Explore the problem space" → One aspect per Task

## Quality Checklist

When adding ideation tasks, consider:

- [ ] Is there a clear question to answer?
- [ ] What output is expected? (decision, doc, prototype)
- [ ] How will we know when exploration is "done"?
- [ ] Are there constraints to the exploration?

## Type-Specific Fields

For ideation Features, consider adding:

```markdown
**Question**: What are we trying to answer?
**Output**: Decision | Document | Prototype | Recommendation
**Constraints**: Time, scope, or resource limits
```

## Ideation Principles

1. **Diverge before converge** - Explore widely, then narrow down
2. **Timebox exploration** - Set limits to avoid endless research
3. **Document dead ends** - Failed ideas are valuable learning
4. **Separate exploration from decision** - Explore first, decide after
