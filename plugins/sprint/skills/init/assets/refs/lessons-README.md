# Lessons

Lessons learned from features and sprint-wide.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_sprint.md` | Sprint-wide lessons (rare, cross-feature) |
| `F{n}-{name}.md` | Feature-specific lessons |

## Naming Convention

- `_sprint.md` - Sprint-wide (created by sprint-init)
- `F{n}-{feature-name}.md` - Per-feature (e.g., `F1-user-auth.md`)

## When to Create

**Feature file**: When a feature is **completed**, move lessons from `active/F{n}-*.md` here.

**Sprint file**: Only for lessons that apply across multiple features or the entire sprint.

## Template
